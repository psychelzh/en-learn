### rate

"Rate" is a *commonly* used word in English works, and has many interesting meanings. Here has a summary according to the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/词典/英语-汉语-简体/rate):

* **Noun**
  * *MEASURE* [C] speed of change / number of times something happens: rate **of** / **at** a tremendous rate
  * *PAYMENT* [C] amount of payment: **going** (= standard) rate **for**
  * *TAX* [plural] 
  * **Statistics** *Collins* the frequency of occurrence of a given event
* **Verb**
  * *JUDGE* [T] judge value/character: rate ... **as** / rate **highly** / rate **a mention** (be considered to be worth reporting)
* **suffix**
  * *first-rate, second-rate, etc* to show how good you think something is

### plaintive

Interestingly, I had thought at first glance that "plaintive" might be similar to "plain" in meaning. To my surprise, it means "sorrowful", the root of which is, just the same as that of "complain", "[\*plak](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*plak-)". The root "\*plak" means "to strike", which perhaps expresses a man striking his breast in **grief**.

In fact, I guess I should connect plaintive with these words: "plaint, complain, plaintiff". These words all have something in common with "lamenting, miserable, sorrowful".

### impudent

Meaning: "rude". The [etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/impudent) of this word is interesting. The meaning of this word comes from Latin *impudentem* "without shame, shameless". Two parts composed this word: *in-* "not, opposite of" + *pudens* "ashamed, modest". And from *pudens*, you would find a word *pudendum*, the meaning of which is "external genitals", and would definitely "cause shame".

### jeopardize

This word looks a little unusual for me, which means [**to risk**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/词典/英语-汉语-简体/jeopardize). An example sentence from [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jeopardize): 

> His health has been jeopardized by poor nutrition.

On [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/jeopardy), you will find the etymology of this word interesting:

> late 14c., jupartie , ioparde, etc., "danger, risk;" earlier "a cunning plan, a stratagem" (c. 1300), from or based on Old French jeu parti "a lost game," more correctly "a divided game, game with even chances" (hence "uncertainty"). The sense perhaps developed in Anglo-French.

> This is from jeu "a game" (from Latin iocus "jest;" see joke (n.)) + parti, past participle of partir "to divide, separate" (10c.), from Latin partire/partiri "to share, part, distribute, divide," from pars "a part, piece, a share" (from PIE root \*pere-(2) "to grant, allot"). Jeopardous "in peril" (mid-15c.) is now obsolete.

Thus, it seems that uncertainty just means that there is risk. Of course, it makes sense that we would take a risk when doing something we do not have a certain knowledge, e.g., the stock market. Uncertainty comes from "even chances", which is the meaning of "pardy".
