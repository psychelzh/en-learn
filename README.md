### rate

"Rate" is a *commonly* used word in English works, and has many interesting meanings. Here has a summary according to the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/词典/英语-汉语-简体/rate):

* **Noun**
  * *MEASURE* [C] speed of change / number of times something happens: rate **of** / **at** a tremendous rate
  * *PAYMENT* [C] amount of payment: **going** (= standard) rate **for**
  * *TAX* [plural] 
  * **Statistics** *Collins* the frequency of occurrence of a given event
* **Verb**
  * *JUDGE* [T] judge value/character: rate ... **as** / rate **highly** / rate **a mention** (be considered to be worth reporting)
* **suffix**
  * *first-rate, second-rate, etc* to show how good you think something is

### plaintive

Interestingly, I had thought at first glance that "plaintive" might be similar to "plain" in meaning. To my surprise, it means "sorrowful", the root of which is, just the same as that of "complain", "[\*plak](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*plak-)". The root "\*plak" means "to strike", which perhaps expresses a man striking his breast in **grief**.

In fact, I guess I should connect plaintive with these words: "plaint, complain, plaintiff". These words all have something in common with "lamenting, miserable, sorrowful".

### impudent

Meaning: "rude". The [etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/impudent) of this word is interesting. The meaning of this word comes from Latin *impudentem* "without shame, shameless". Two parts composed this word: *in-* "not, opposite of" + *pudens* "ashamed, modest". And from *pudens*, you would find a word *pudendum*, the meaning of which is "external genitals*, and would definitely "cause shame".
